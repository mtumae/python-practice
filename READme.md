***

1. **Sum of all elements in a list** (sum_of_items.py)

    >The function ```listsum()```takes an argument ```list``` and loops through it adding the values of the list to a variable ```total```.
    


2. **Check if a number is even or odd** (even_or_odd.py)
    >The function ```evenodd()``` takes and argument ```num```. If the remainder when ```num``` is divided by 2 is equal to 0, the function returns **even** and **odd** otherwise.

3. **Compute a factorial using a loop**(factorial_loop.py)
    >The function ``factorial`` takes and argument ```n``` and computes its factorial.

4. **Reverse a string** (reverse_string.py)
    >The function ```reversestring()``` takes an argument ```string_input``` and loops through it in reverse while appending the corresponding elements to a new array ```reversed```. Once the loop is completed the elements of the ```reversed``` array are joined together and printed out to the console.

5. **Factorial recursive** (factorial_recursive.py)



6. **Sum of digits of a number** (sum_of_number.py)
    >The function ```numsum()``` takes an argument ```number``` and converts it to a string ```numstr```, which is an array, allowing the following for loop to loop over the strings elements, while also converting them to integers and adding them to a variable ```total```.
